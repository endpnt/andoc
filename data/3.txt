                            Cork Street: Tuesday morn (August, 1796).

  MY DEAR CASSANDRA,

  Here I am once more in this scene of dissipation and vice, and I
  begin already to find my morals corrupted. We reached Staines
  yesterday, I do not (know) when, without suffering so much from the
  heat as I had hoped to do. We set off again this morning at seven
  o'clock, and had a very pleasant drive, as the morning was cloudy
  and perfectly cool. I came all the way in the chaise from Hertford
  Bridge.

  Edward and Frank are both gone out to seek their fortunes; the
  latter is to return soon and help us seek ours. The former we shall
  never see again. We are to be at Astley's to-night, which I am glad
  of. Edward has heard from Henry this morning. He has not been at
  the races at all, unless his driving Miss Pearson over to Rowling
  one day can be so called. We shall find him there on Thursday.

  I hope you are all alive after our melancholy parting yesterday,
  and that you pursued your intended avocation with success. God
  bless you! I must leave off, for we are going out.

                      Yours very affectionately,

                                                           J. AUSTEN.

  Everybody's love.
