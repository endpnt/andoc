andoc
=====

A collaborative web tool to enrich content.

The current python/js code is a simple prototype 
using CherryPy, pickle, lxml and simplejson.

$ easy_install lxml simplejson cherrypy
$ python andoc.py
$ open 'http://localhost:8080'

Idea
====

The idea of andoc is the enrichment and analysis of a wide range of content.

Like wikipdia or etherpad/gobby, it is a collaborative tool where many users
can work on the same content at the same time. However, andoc is not about
creating content but aims to enrich existing data with a specific set of meta
data.

In the second step, andoc is analyzing the collected meta data and provides
the user with dynamic visualisations to access and navigate the content.

This is especially helpful with larger sets of data.

The Model
=========

The main meta data in andoc is the concept of a "event". A event usually 
consists of a place and a time and agents (or persons) present at the
event.

Therefore one process in andoc is to identify these elements in the existing 
data.

Example
=======

Let's take a snippet from a mail conversation and enrich the content.

[a] is a agent, [d] a date, [p] a place and [e] a event.

    We left <Warren[a]> at <Dean Gate[p]>, in our way home <last night[d]>, and he
    is now on his road to <town[p]>. He left his love, &c., to you, and I will
    deliver it when we meet. <Henry[a]> goes to <Harden[p]> <to-day[d]> in his way
    to his Master's degree.  We shall feel the loss of these two most agreeable
    young men exceedingly, and shall have nothing to console us till the arrival of
    the <Coopers[a]> on <Tuesday[d]>. As they will stay here till the <Monday[d]>
    following, perhaps <Caroline[a]> will go to the <Ashe ball[e]> with me, though
    I dare say she will not.

(You can try this with the current prototype as well, using a fancy web-ui.)

Andoc would then know about the existence of:

Agents:
 - Warren
 - Henry
 - Coopers
 - Caroline

Places:
 - Dean Gate
 - Town
 - Harden

Date:
 - last night
 - to-day
 - Monday
 - Tuesday

Event:
 - Ashe ball

In the actual interface the user should be provided with additional tools,
so that "Monday" or "to-day" in the context of this document would actually
represent a real date.

Since some of the steps can be done with the help of natural language
processing, andoc aims to provide automatic processing of the data as well.

Analysis
========

The afford to enrich the documents, should lead to a direct improvement 
for the users:

* Provide additional information about person, places and events
  from sources like wikipedia along the data. Context matters.

* Visualisation of semantic relations, social networks, related data
  and events.

* Grouping of related data based on event, place or person.

* Timeline of events and data.

* Geo/map presentation of events and data.

All those presentations should be updated constantly as the enrichment process
progresses.
